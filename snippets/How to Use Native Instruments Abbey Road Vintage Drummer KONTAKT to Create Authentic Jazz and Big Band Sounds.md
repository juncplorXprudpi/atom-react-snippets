## The Two Ultra-Rare Kits
  
Native Instruments Abbey Road Vintage Drummer KONTAKT features two drum kits that date from the 1930s to 1940s, each with a choice of three snares. These kits have a smooth, dynamic, and warm sound that is perfect for jazz and big band genres.
  
The Ebony Kit is an open, mellow, and smooth-sounding kit featuring original James Blades 12â and 13 â toms and a 26â Leedy bass drum â all tuned with original calfskin drum heads. This kit is ideal for softer and more laid-back styles of jazz.
  
The Ivory Kit is a classic Slingerland Radio King kit from the early 1940s with 13â and 16â toms and a 24â bass drum. Also equipped with original calfskin heads, this kit is warm, chunky, and somewhat tighter than the Ebony kit. This kit is great for more upbeat and energetic styles of jazz and big band.
  
## The Mixer Section
  
Native Instruments Abbey Road Vintage Drummer KONTAKT allows you to create the perfect drum submix completely within the instrument, using the dedicated mixer section. You can adjust the levels, panning, and effects of each individual drum mic, as well as blend between modern and period channels for a custom sound.
  
The modern channels use state-of-the-art recording equipment to capture the drums with clarity and detail, while the period channels use vintage microphones and preamps from the 1930s and 1940s to add some character and warmth to the sound. You can also use the tape saturation effect to emulate the sound of analog tape recording.
  
Additionally, you can apply high-quality studio effects to your drum mix, such as EQ, compression, reverb, and transient master. These effects can help you shape the tone, dynamics, space, and punch of your drums. You can also use the mixer presets to quickly get a professional sound with just one click.
  
## The Groove Library
  
Native Instruments Abbey Road Vintage Drummer KONTAKT also comes with a comprehensive groove library that contains over 1,300 MIDI patterns played by professional drummers. These patterns cover a wide range of jazz and big band styles, such as swing, bebop, blues, latin, dixieland, ragtime, and more.
  
You can drag and drop these patterns into your DAW or use them within the instrument's groove player. You can also edit them using the built-in MIDI editor or create your own patterns from scratch. The groove library is a great source of inspiration and a convenient way to add some groove and variation to your drum tracks.
  
## The Brush Articulations
  
One of the unique features of Native Instruments Abbey Road Vintage Drummer KONTAKT is the brush articulations that are available for the first time in the ABBEY ROAD DRUMMER series. These articulations add another expressive dimension to your drum sounds, as they allow you to create subtle nuances and textures with brushes.
  
You can choose from different brush strokes, such as sweeps, taps, circles, flams, rolls, accents, and more. You can also adjust the speed and pressure of the brushes using key switches or MIDI controllers. The brush articulations are especially suitable for softer and more intimate styles of jazz.
  
## Conclusion
  
Native Instruments Abbey Road Vintage Drummer KONTAKT is a powerful and versatile software instrument that lets you create authentic jazz and big band sounds with ease. Whether you want to recreate the sound of a golden era or add some vintage flavor to your modern productions, this instrument has everything you need.
